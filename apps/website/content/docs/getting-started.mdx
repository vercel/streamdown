Get up and running with Streamdown in minutes. This guide will walk you through installation, configuration, and your first implementation.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **React** >= 19.1.1 (compatible with React 18+)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)

## Installation

You can install Streamdown directly, or use it as part of the [AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements) library.

### AI Elements

Install the `message` component from AI Elements:

```package-install
npx ai-elements@latest add message
```

### Direct Installation

Install Streamdown using your preferred package manager:

```package-install
npm i streamdown
```

## Tailwind CSS Configuration

Streamdown uses Tailwind CSS for styling. To ensure the styles are properly applied, you need to configure your Tailwind setup to include Streamdown's source files.

### Tailwind v4

Add the following CSS source directive to your `globals.css` or main CSS file:

```css title="globals.css"
@source "../node_modules/streamdown/dist/*.js";
```

Make sure the path matches the location of your `node_modules` folder relative to your CSS file.

### Tailwind v3

Add Streamdown to your `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js title="tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './node_modules/streamdown/dist/*.js',
  ],
  // ... rest of your config
}
```
