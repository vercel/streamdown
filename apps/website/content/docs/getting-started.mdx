Welcome to Geistdocs! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to set up and customize your documentation site.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed on your system
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm package manager
- A **GitHub account** for repository hosting
- Basic familiarity with **Markdown** and **React**

## Installation

### 1. Create a New Project

Create a new repository using the Geistdocs template:

```bash
gh repo create mydocs --template vercel/geistdocs --clone
cd mydocs
```

Alternatively, you can use the template directly on GitHub:
1. Visit the Geistdocs repository
2. Click "Use this template"
3. Clone your new repository

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install all dependencies including Next.js, Fumadocs, and the AI SDK.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit the environment variables in the `.env.local` file.

### 4. Delete the Geistdocs content

Delete all the files within `content/docs`. These are the default files that come with the Geistdocs template.

```bash
rm -rf content/docs/*
```

### 5. Start Development Server

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your documentation site.
