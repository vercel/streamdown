- Are automatically disabled during streaming when `isAnimating={true}`
- Can be customized or disabled via the `controls` prop

## Image Buttons

### Download Images

Every image rendered by Streamdown includes a download button that appears on hover. A download button will be shown for images in the bottom-right corner on hover. Streamdown will automatically detect the image format and save it with the correct extension. The image's alt text will be used as the default filename.

## Table Buttons

### Copy Tables

Tables include a copy button that allows users to copy the table data in multiple formats. The copy button will be shown for tables in the top-right corner on hover. The copy button will copy the table as Markdown by default. It will also copy the HTML representation for rich pasting.

### Download Tables

Tables can be downloaded in two formats: CSV and Markdown. The download button will be shown for tables in the top-right corner on hover. The download button will download the table as CSV by default. It will also download the table as Markdown for documentation and note-taking.

## Code Block Buttons

### Copy Code

Every code block includes a copy button that appears on hover. The copy button will be shown for code blocks in the top-right corner on hover. The copy button will copy the raw code without syntax highlighting. It will also show a checkmark for 2 seconds after successful copy. It will be disabled during streaming to prevent copying incomplete code.

### Download Code

Code blocks also include a download button that appears on hover. The download button will be shown for code blocks in the top-right corner on hover. The download button will download the code with the appropriate file extension based on language. It will also use "file.[extension]" as the filename. It will preserve formatting and indentation.

## Mermaid Diagram Buttons

### Copy Diagrams

Mermaid diagrams include a copy button that allows users to copy the diagram source code. The copy button will be shown for Mermaid diagrams in the top-right corner on hover. The copy button will copy the raw Mermaid syntax for easy sharing and editing.

### Download Diagrams

Mermaid diagrams can be downloaded as SVG files. The download button will be shown for Mermaid diagrams in the top-right corner on hover. The download button will download the rendered diagram as an SVG file. It will use "diagram.svg" as the default filename.

### Fullscreen View

Mermaid diagrams include a fullscreen button for better viewing of complex diagrams. The fullscreen button will be shown for Mermaid diagrams in the top-right corner on hover. The fullscreen button will open the diagram in a modal overlay for detailed inspection. Users can press Escape or click outside to close the fullscreen view.
