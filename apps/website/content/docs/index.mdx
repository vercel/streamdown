description: A modern documentation template for spinning up Vercel documentation microsites quickly and consistently
---

Geistdocs is a production-ready documentation template built with Next.js 16 and Fumadocs. It's designed as an internal Vercel template for creating documentation microsites with a consistent look, feel, and feature set across projects.

## Overview

This template provides everything you need to build beautiful, functional documentation sites with minimal setup. It combines the power of MDX for content authoring with modern features like AI-powered chat, GitHub Discussions integration, and advanced search capabilities.

## Key Features

### Content Authoring

- **MDX-powered documentation** - Write docs in MDX with full React component support
- **Syntax highlighting** - Beautiful code blocks powered by Shiki
- **TypeScript support** - Full type safety across the documentation system
- **Custom components** - Extend with your own React components

### Interactive Features

- **AI-powered chat** - Built-in AI assistant that understands your documentation
- **GitHub Discussions** - Allow users to provide feedback directly to GitHub
- **Advanced search** - Fast, fuzzy search through all documentation
- **RSS feed** - Automatic RSS feed generation for content updates

### User Experience

- **Modern UI** - Beautiful, accessible components built with Radix UI
- **Dark mode** - Built-in theme switching with system preference detection
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach that works everywhere
- **Fast performance** - Optimized with Next.js 16 App Router

### Developer Experience

- **Zero-config linting** - Uses Ultracite (Biome preset) for strict code quality
- **Hot reload** - Instant feedback during development
- **Type-safe content** - Generated types for all MDX content
- **Easy deployment** - Optimized for Vercel with one-click deployment

## Architecture

Geistdocs is built on a modern stack:

- **Next.js 16** - React framework with App Router
- **Fumadocs** - Documentation framework for content management
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives
- **Vercel AI SDK** - AI chat functionality
- **Octokit** - GitHub API integration

## Use Cases

This template is ideal for:

- **Product documentation** - Feature guides, tutorials, and references
- **API documentation** - Endpoint documentation with code examples
- **Developer tools** - CLI tools, SDKs, and framework documentation
- **Internal wikis** - Team knowledge bases and guides
- **Project documentation** - Open source project documentation

## Core Concepts

### Content Structure

Documentation lives in the `content/docs/` directory. Each `.mdx` file becomes a page with automatic routing based on the file path.

### Frontmatter

Every documentation page requires frontmatter metadata:

```mdx
---
title: Page Title
description: Brief description of the page
---
```

### Navigation

Navigation is configured using `meta.json` files in each directory, allowing you to control ordering and grouping of pages.

### Components

Import and use React components directly in your MDX:

```mdx
<Card title="Learn more" href="/docs/getting-started" />
```

## What's Included

The template comes with several built-in features out of the box:

- **Edit on GitHub** - Direct links for users to propose changes
- **Feedback widget** - Emotion-based feedback that creates GitHub Discussions
- **Ask AI** - Context-aware AI chat for answering questions
- **Open in Chat** - Send documentation to external AI platforms
- **RSS feed** - Automatic feed generation at `/rss.xml`
