description: The root provider component that handles layout shifts, notifications, and analytics
---

The `GeistdocsProvider` is a wrapper component that sits at the root of your application. It wraps Fumadocs' `RootProvider` and adds Geistdocs-specific functionality to make everything work seamlessly.

## What It Does

The provider handles four main things for you:

1. **Layout Shifts** - Automatically adjusts page padding when the AI chat sidebar opens on desktop
2. **Toast Notifications** - Provides a global notification system for user feedback
3. **Analytics** - Integrates Vercel Analytics for tracking page views and performance
4. **Search** - Configures the search dialog and connects it to your search API

## Usage

Wrap your application with the provider in your root layout:

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
import { GeistdocsProvider } from "@/components/geistdocs/provider";

const Layout = ({ children }: LayoutProps) => (
  <html lang="en">
    <body>
      <GeistdocsProvider>
        <Navbar />
        {children}
      </GeistdocsProvider>
    </body>
  </html>
);
```

That's it. The provider handles everything automatically.

## Layout Shifts

When users open the AI chat on desktop, the provider automatically adds padding to prevent content from being hidden behind the sidebar. On mobile, the chat opens as a drawer instead, so no padding is needed.

You don't need to do anything - the provider detects the screen size and chat state automatically.

## Toast Notifications

The provider includes a global toast notification system. Use it anywhere in your app:

```tsx
import { toast } from "sonner";

toast.success("Changes saved");
toast.error("Something went wrong");
```

## Analytics

Vercel Analytics is automatically included and tracks:
- Page views
- Web Vitals
- User interactions
- Performance metrics

No configuration needed - it works automatically when deployed on Vercel.

## Optional Props

The provider accepts a few optional props if you need to customize behavior:

- **`basePath`** - Set a custom base path for API routes (useful for subdirectory deployments)
- **`className`** - Add custom CSS classes to the wrapper
- **`search`** - Override search configuration options

Most projects won't need to customize these - the defaults work for standard deployments.
