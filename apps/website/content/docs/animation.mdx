Streamdown supports per-word streaming animation through the built-in `animated` prop. Words fade in as they mount, creating a smooth text-reveal effect during AI streaming. When streaming ends, the animation is removed entirely, leaving zero DOM overhead on completed messages.

## Enabling animation

Import the animation CSS and set the `animated` prop:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { Streamdown } from "streamdown";
import "streamdown/styles.css";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Streamdown animated isAnimating={status === "streaming"}>
      {markdown}
    </Streamdown>
  );
}
```

The `isAnimating` prop controls when the animation is active. When `false`, the animate plugin is excluded from the rehype pipeline entirely, so completed messages render as plain text with no extra `<span>` wrappers.

## How it works

The animation is a rehype transformer that:

1. Walks the HAST tree, visiting text nodes
2. Splits each text node into per-word `<span>` elements with `data-sd-animate`
3. Sets CSS custom properties for animation name, duration, and easing
4. Skips text inside `code`, `pre`, `svg`, `math`, and `annotation` elements

React's reconciliation ensures only newly-mounted spans trigger the CSS animation. Combined with a short default duration (150ms), this makes batch token arrivals look smooth rather than "chunky."

## Animation types

Three built-in animations are included in `styles.css`:

### fadeIn (default)

A simple opacity transition from invisible to visible.

```tsx
<Streamdown animated={{ animation: "fadeIn" }} isAnimating={status === "streaming"}>
  {markdown}
</Streamdown>
```

### blurIn

Combines opacity with a blur-to-sharp transition. Works well with fast-streaming models where many tokens arrive at once — the blur masks the batch appearance better than pure opacity.

```tsx
<Streamdown animated={{ animation: "blurIn" }} isAnimating={status === "streaming"}>
  {markdown}
</Streamdown>
```

### slideUp

Words fade in while sliding up 4px, creating a subtle rising effect.

```tsx
<Streamdown animated={{ animation: "slideUp" }} isAnimating={status === "streaming"}>
  {markdown}
</Streamdown>
```

## Configuration

Pass an options object to `animated` to customize animation behavior:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { Streamdown } from "streamdown";
import "streamdown/styles.css";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Streamdown
      animated={{
        animation: "blurIn",  // "fadeIn" | "blurIn" | "slideUp" | custom string
        duration: 200,         // milliseconds (default: 150)
        easing: "ease-out",    // CSS timing function (default: "ease")
        sep: "word",           // "word" | "char" (default: "word")
      }}
      isAnimating={status === "streaming"}
    >
      {markdown}
    </Streamdown>
  );
}
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `animation` | `string` | `"fadeIn"` | Animation name. Built-in: `fadeIn`, `blurIn`, `slideUp`. Custom strings are prefixed with `sd-`. |
| `duration` | `number` | `150` | Animation duration in milliseconds. |
| `easing` | `string` | `"ease"` | CSS timing function. |
| `sep` | `"word" \| "char"` | `"word"` | Split text by word or character. |

### Character-level animation

Set `sep: "char"` to animate each character individually instead of whole words:

```tsx
<Streamdown animated={{ animation: "fadeIn", sep: "char" }} isAnimating={status === "streaming"}>
  {markdown}
</Streamdown>
```

This creates a typewriter-like effect but generates more DOM nodes. Use it sparingly.

## Custom animations

Define your own `@keyframes` and reference them by name:

```css title="app/globals.css"
@keyframes sd-myCustomAnimation {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.95);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
```

```tsx
<Streamdown animated={{ animation: "myCustomAnimation" }} isAnimating={status === "streaming"}>
  {markdown}
</Streamdown>
```

The animation name is automatically prefixed with `sd-`, so define your keyframes as `sd-yourName`.

## Advanced usage

For direct access to the rehype plugin (e.g. in custom pipelines), use `createAnimatePlugin`:

```tsx
import { createAnimatePlugin } from "streamdown";

const animate = createAnimatePlugin({
  animation: "blurIn",
  duration: 200,
});

// animate.rehypePlugin is a standard rehype plugin
```

## Skipped elements

The animation skips text inside these elements to avoid breaking their layout:

- `<code>` — inline and block code
- `<pre>` — preformatted text
- `<svg>` — vector graphics
- `<math>` — MathML elements
- `<annotation>` — MathML annotations

This means code blocks, syntax-highlighted code, math equations, and diagrams render without animation spans.

## Fast-streaming models

Fast models can dump many tokens per React commit. The default 150ms duration with `animation-fill-mode: both` ensures words start invisible and end visible, making simultaneous mounts look intentional.

For smoother results with fast models:

- Use `blurIn` — blur masks batch arrivals better than opacity alone
- Increase duration slightly to 200-300ms
- Consider `ease-out` easing for a more natural deceleration

```tsx
<Streamdown
  animated={{
    animation: "blurIn",
    duration: 250,
    easing: "ease-out",
  }}
  isAnimating={status === "streaming"}
>
  {markdown}
</Streamdown>
```

## CSS custom properties

Each animated span receives these CSS custom properties via inline styles:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--sd-animation` | The `@keyframes` name to use |
| `--sd-duration` | Animation duration |
| `--sd-easing` | CSS timing function |

The `[data-sd-animate]` selector in `styles.css` reads these properties:

```css
[data-sd-animate] {
  animation: var(--sd-animation, sd-fadeIn)
    var(--sd-duration, 150ms)
    var(--sd-easing, ease) both;
}
```

You can override these in your own CSS for more control.
