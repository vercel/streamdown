description: A single file containing all your documentation in plain text for AI consumption
---

Geistdocs implements the [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/) - a convention that provides all your documentation content in a single, AI-readable text file. This makes it easy for language models to understand your entire documentation at once.

## What It Is

The `/llms.txt` endpoint returns all your documentation pages as plain Markdown in a single response. Each page is separated by blank lines, making it easy for AI tools to parse and understand your complete documentation.

### Access

```
https://yourdomain.com/llms.txt
```

Returns all documentation pages concatenated together as plain text.

## How It Works

The endpoint:
1. Fetches all pages from your documentation
2. Processes each page to extract clean Markdown
3. Combines everything into a single text file
4. Returns it as `text/plain`

Pages are joined with double newlines (`\n\n`) for clear separation.

## Use Cases

This feature enables:

- **AI Training** - Provide your docs as context for AI assistants
- **Search Indexing** - Feed your entire documentation to search systems
- **Content Analysis** - Analyze patterns and content across all docs
- **Bulk Processing** - Process all documentation at once
- **LLM Context** - Give language models complete documentation context

## The llms.txt Standard

The llms.txt standard is a simple convention that makes documentation more accessible to AI tools. It's similar in spirit to `robots.txt` but designed for language models instead of search crawlers.

## Performance

The endpoint is optimized for performance:
- Uses `Promise.all` to process pages in parallel
- Caching disabled (`revalidate = false`) for fresh content
- Statically generated at build time for fast responses
