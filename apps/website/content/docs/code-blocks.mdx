Streamdown provides beautiful, interactive code blocks with syntax highlighting powered by [Shiki](https://shiki.style/). Every code block includes a copy button and supports a wide range of programming languages.

## Basic Usage

Create code blocks using triple backticks with an optional language identifier:

````markdown
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
````

Streamdown will automatically apply syntax highlighting based on the specified language.

## Supported Languages

Streamdown supports 200+ programming languages through a hybrid loading approach:

### Bundled Languages (Instant Loading)

These 15 common languages are bundled with Streamdown for zero-latency syntax highlighting:

- **Web**: JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX, HTML, CSS
- **Data**: JSON, YAML, TOML
- **Shell**: Bash, Shell Script
- **Backend**: Python, Go
- **Markup**: Markdown, SQL

### On-Demand Languages (Loaded from CDN)

All other languages are loaded on-demand from the CDN (default: `https://www.streamdown.ai/cdn`) when first used, including:

- **Backend**: Java, Rust, C, C++, C#, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, Swift, Scala
- **Functional**: Haskell, Elixir, Clojure, F#, OCaml, Erlang
- **Data**: XML, GraphQL, Prisma, Protocol Buffers
- **Shell**: PowerShell, Zsh, Fish
- **Markup**: LaTeX, MDX, AsciiDoc
- **And 180+ more languages**

Languages are cached after the first load, so subsequent uses are instant.

For offline or air-gapped environments, see [Self-Hosting CDN](/docs/self-hosting-cdn) to learn how to self-host language files.

### Language Examples

#### TypeScript

````markdown
```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

async function fetchUser(id: number): Promise<User> {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
  return response.json();
}
```
````

#### Python

````markdown
```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence up to n terms."""
    fib = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
    return fib

print(fibonacci(10))
```
````

#### Rust

````markdown
```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().sum();
    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
}
```
````

## Theme Configuration

Streamdown uses dual themes for light and dark modes. You can customize the themes using the `shikiTheme` prop:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { Streamdown } from "streamdown";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Streamdown shikiTheme={["dracula", "dracula"]}>{markdown}</Streamdown>
  );
}
```

### Bundled Themes (Instant Loading)

These themes are bundled with Streamdown for zero-latency loading:

- `github-light` (default light theme)
- `github-dark` (default dark theme)

### On-Demand Themes (Loaded from CDN)

All other Shiki themes are loaded on-demand from the CDN (default: `https://www.streamdown.ai/cdn`) when first used, including popular themes like:

- `dracula`, `nord`, `one-dark-pro`, `monokai`
- `catppuccin-latte`, `catppuccin-mocha`
- `vitesse-light`, `vitesse-dark`
- `tokyo-night`, `slack-dark`, `slack-ochin`
- And [many more](https://shiki.style/themes)

Themes are cached after the first load, so subsequent uses are instant.

For offline or air-gapped environments, see [Self-Hosting CDN](/docs/self-hosting-cdn) to learn how to self-host theme files.

## Interactive Features

### Copy Button

Every code block includes a copy button that appears on hover. Users can click to copy the entire code block content to their clipboard.

The copy button:

- Appears on hover (desktop) or is always visible (mobile)
- Provides visual feedback on successful copy
- Is automatically disabled during streaming (when `isAnimating={true}`)

### Disable Copy Button

You can disable the copy button using the `controls` prop:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
<Streamdown controls={{ code: false }}>{markdown}</Streamdown>
```

Or disable all controls:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
<Streamdown controls={false}>{markdown}</Streamdown>
```

## Inline Code

Inline code uses backticks and receives subtle styling:

```markdown
Use the `useState` hook to manage state in React.
```

Inline code is styled with:

- Monospace font family
- Subtle background color
- Rounded corners
- Appropriate padding

## Code Block Styling

Code blocks include:

- **Line Numbers** - Optional line numbers for reference
- **Rounded Corners** - Modern, polished appearance
- **Proper Padding** - Comfortable spacing
- **Scrolling** - Horizontal scroll for long lines
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts to container width

## Streaming Considerations

Code blocks work seamlessly with streaming content:

### Incomplete Code Blocks

When a code block is streaming in, Streamdown handles the incomplete state gracefully:

````markdown
```javascript
function example() {
  // Streaming in progress...
```
````

The unterminated block parser ensures the code block renders properly even without the closing backticks.

### Disabling Interactions During Streaming

Use the `isAnimating` prop to disable copy buttons while streaming:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
<Streamdown isAnimating={isStreaming}>{markdown}</Streamdown>
```

This prevents users from copying incomplete code.
