---

The "Open in Chat" feature enables users to seamlessly transfer documentation context to their preferred AI assistant. With a single click, users can open the current page in external AI chat platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, v0, Cursor, and more.

## How It Works

On every documentation page, users will find an "Open in chat" button in the table of contents sidebar. When clicked, a menu appears with options to open the page in various AI platforms:

1. User clicks "Open in chat"
2. A dropdown menu shows available platforms
3. User selects their preferred AI assistant
4. The platform opens with a pre-filled prompt containing the page URL and context

The prompt automatically includes:
```
Read this page, I want to ask questions about it. [URL]
```

This allows the AI assistant to fetch and understand the page content before answering user questions.

## Supported Platforms

The feature integrates with multiple popular AI platforms:

### Code & Development Tools

- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)** - AI-powered code editor
- **[v0](https://v0.dev/)** - Vercel's AI interface design tool

### General AI Assistants

- **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)** - OpenAI's conversational AI
- **[Claude](https://claude.ai/)** - Anthropic's AI assistant
- **[T3](https://t3.gg/)** - T3 Stack AI assistant
- **[Scira](https://scira.app/)** - AI-powered documentation assistant

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required for the "Open in Chat" feature. It works automatically as long as your base environment is configured:

```bash title=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL="your-domain.com"
```

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` environment variable is used to generate the full URL for each page.

## User Experience

### Desktop Experience

The "Open in chat" button appears in the table of contents sidebar with an external link icon. Clicking it reveals a dropdown menu with all available platforms.

### Platform-Specific Behavior

Each platform has its own integration:

- **Browser-based platforms** (ChatGPT, Claude, v0): Open in a new browser tab with the prompt pre-filled
- **Desktop applications** (Cursor): Open using a custom URL scheme that launches the application
- **Specialized tools** (T3, Scira): Open with platform-specific parameters and context

## Benefits

### For Users

1. **Seamless Workflow** - No need to manually copy URLs or switch contexts
2. **Consistent Experience** - Same starting point regardless of preferred AI platform
3. **Time Saving** - Instant access to AI assistance with proper context
4. **Choice of Tools** - Use the AI platform they're most comfortable with

### For Documentation Authors

1. **Enhanced Support** - Users can get help beyond what's in the docs
2. **Reduced Support Burden** - AI assistants handle common questions
3. **Better User Engagement** - Users can explore topics more deeply
4. **Platform Flexibility** - Support users' diverse AI preferences

## Implementation Details

The "Open in Chat" feature is implemented using:

- `components/geistdocs/open-in-chat.tsx` - Component wrapper
- `components/ai-elements/open-in-chat.tsx` - Reusable UI components for each platform
- `components/geistdocs/docs-page.tsx` - Integration into page layout

Each platform component handles:
- URL generation with proper encoding
- Icon and branding
- Platform-specific launch behavior

## Customization

### Adding More Platforms

You can extend the feature to support additional AI platforms by editing the `OpenInChat` component:

```tsx title="components/geistdocs/open-in-chat.tsx"
<OpenInContent align="start" side="top">
  <OpenInv0 />
  <OpenInSeparator />
  <OpenInChatGPT />
  <OpenInClaude />
  <OpenInT3 />
  <OpenInScira />
  <OpenInCursor />
  {/* Add your custom platform here */}
</OpenInContent>
```

### Customizing the Prompt

The pre-filled prompt is generated in the `DocsPage` component. You can customize it by editing:

```typescript title="components/geistdocs/docs-page.tsx"
const query = `Read this page, I want to ask questions about it. ${url}`;
```

For example, you might want to:
- Add specific instructions for the AI
- Include additional context about your project
- Customize the prompt based on page type or category

## Best Practices

### 1. Set Expectations

Consider adding a note in your documentation about:
- What users can expect from AI assistants
- Limitations of AI-generated responses
- Importance of verifying critical information

### 2. Optimize Page URLs

Ensure your URLs are:
- Clean and descriptive
- Stable (avoid frequent changes)
- SEO-friendly
- Easy to share

### 3. Monitor Platform Changes

AI platforms regularly update their APIs and URL schemes. Periodically check that:
- Integration links still work
- URL parameters are still supported
- Platform branding is current

### 4. Consider Privacy

Be transparent about:
- What information is shared with external platforms
- User privacy implications
- Data handling by third-party AI services

## Use Cases

### For Documentation Readers

- **Deep Dives**: Ask follow-up questions to understand complex topics
- **Code Examples**: Get help adapting examples to specific use cases
- **Troubleshooting**: Describe a problem and get debugging assistance
- **Learning**: Request explanations at different skill levels

### For Tutorial Content

- **Interactive Learning**: Users can ask "what if" questions
- **Personalized Paths**: Get recommendations based on their goals
- **Concept Clarification**: Request alternative explanations
- **Practice Exercises**: Generate practice problems based on the material

### For API Documentation

- **Code Generation**: Ask for code examples in specific languages
- **Integration Help**: Get step-by-step guidance for complex integrations
- **Error Resolution**: Troubleshoot API errors with AI assistance
- **Best Practices**: Learn recommended patterns and approaches

## Limitations

### Platform Availability

- Some platforms may not be accessible in all regions
- Desktop applications require installation
- Some platforms may require accounts or subscriptions

### Context Limitations

- AI assistants may not have access to private or gated content
- Very long pages might exceed context limits
- Frequently updated content might not reflect latest changes

### Accuracy Considerations

- AI responses may contain errors or outdated information
- Users should verify important information against official docs
- AI understanding is limited by training data and page content

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Usage Analytics** - Track which platforms are most popular
2. **Custom Instructions** - Allow page-specific AI instructions
3. **More Platforms** - Add support for additional AI tools
4. **Context Enhancement** - Include related pages or previous sections
5. **Direct Integration** - Embed platform-specific widgets instead of redirecting
